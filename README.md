### Hi 👋, I'm Divyanshu Sahu

### Glad to see you here!

My interest lies in Full Stack Development and Information Security. I am a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. I was a member of InfoSecIITR (a group of security enthusiasts from IIT Roorkee). I like participating in many Capture the Flag (CTF) events. During my free time, I love reading novels (preferably fiction).
